 Stores Python Practice

An attempt is being made over time to put more practice into personal projects. Most of my experience in Python has been gained through testing in ESRI ArcGIS Arcpy using mostly vanilla Python. Last fall, I went to a Python meetup, and saw a presentation on someone's module. It was focused on being a support tool for a DM in Dungeons and Dragons. It opened my eyes to the continued power of Python. 

While what I use Python for currently is strong, it feels like it pales in comparison to what I witnessed. There is so much more to learn and do.
